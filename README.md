 <summary><h3>🌍 Ahmed's Tech Adventure</h3></summary>
Born in Egypt and raised in Oman, my life's been a vibrant mix of cultures, each as colorful and diverse as a bag of jellybeans. I'm Ahmed, a tech enthusiast with a flair for the creative and the analytical!

Fast-forward to the USA, where my tech journey took a leap. I've been buzzing around Rutgers and UCC, diving into research projects that meld computer science with real-world conundrums. Think of me as a digital detective, unearthing clues in the code and piecing together puzzles in programming.

But wait, there's more! High school wasn't just about hitting the books for me. I rocked out in a musical band, dribbled in soccer, and scored in basketball. Oh, and did I mention the black belt in Shotokan karate? Yeah, I can kick it both in the dojo and in the debugger!

These experiences aren't just hobbies; they're the threads that weave my unique story. Each melody, match, and martial arts move has shaped my approach to technology and teamwork.

So, here I am, coding my way through challenges, collaborating on innovative solutions, and always ready to learn something new. Whether it's a complex algorithm or a power chord, I'm all in. Let's make some tech magic happen!
